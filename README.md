# KernelBeep
Theoretically, this shit can do "beep" (via a function call from Hardware Abstraction Layer - HalMakeBeep), but this shit cannot make "beep" properly.

## How to run this
1. Find WDK by Microsoft on MSDN
2. Instal WDK by Microsoft
3. Create driver project in Visual Studio (2017 or older I think)
4. Compile driver
6. Make sure it doesn't work
