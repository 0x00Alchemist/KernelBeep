# HalMakeShitBeep
Theoretically, this shit can do "beep" (via a function call from Hardware Abstraction Layer - HalMakeBeep), but this shit cannot make "beep" properly.

## How to run this fuck
1. Fuck you
2. Fuck WDK by Microsoft
3. Instal WDK by Microsoft
4. Create shit driver project in Visual Studio Shitpost (2017 or older I think)
5. Compile this shit
6. Make sure it doesn't work
